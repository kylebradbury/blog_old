            "content": "Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. David McCullough . Early in my career, I was told that writing was the single most important action I could take for clear thinking, creativity, and productivity. At the time, I promptly ignored that advice and wrote when I had a deadline to meet and rarely more. If there&#39;s anything I&#39;ve learned over my career thus far is how vitally important the act of writing is for clear and coherent thinking and for developing new ideas. . I&#39;m writing this blog, then, for two purposes:(1) to share some musings on machine learning, energy, and other research concepts that I hope may be of interest to others, and (2) organize my own thoughts and This blog will focus on various topics, but primarily three topics: . Research summaries on machine learning and/or energy systems | Machine learning and data science concept tutorials | Practices and lessons learned in research and teaching |",
